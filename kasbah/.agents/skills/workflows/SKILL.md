# Workflows Documentation

This skill provides comprehensive documentation and guidance for the Mistral Workflows framework, which is designed for building durable, fault-tolerant workflows with orchestrated activities.

## About Workflows

Mistral Workflows is a durable-execution orchestration platform that accelerates the development and reliable execution of complex, AI-driven workflows. It combines a user-friendly API with a rich Python framework (`mistralai.workflows`) optimized for Mistral's AI services, providing fault-tolerant execution, automatic retries, and durable state that survives crashes — from simple sequences to long-running, stateful processes (seconds to years).

## SDK Version and Imports

This skill targets the **`mistralai-workflows` SDK v3.4.0 and higher**:

```bash
uv add "mistralai-workflows>=3.4.0,<4.0.0"
```

**Canonical import style** used throughout this skill:

```python
import mistralai.workflows as workflows

@workflows.workflow.define(name="my_workflow")
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflows.workflow.entrypoint
    async def run(self, data: str) -> str:
        ...
```

Focused snippets may use `from mistralai.workflows import workflow, activity, ...` instead.

**Always use the SDK; never import `temporalio` directly.** The SDK re-exports everything user code needs so workflows stay portable and deterministic:

- `workflow.now()`, `workflow.uuid4()`, `workflow.random()` — deterministic replacements for `datetime.now()`, `uuid.uuid4()`, `random` inside workflows
- `workflow.wait_condition()`, `workflow.continue_as_new()`, `workflow.execute_workflow()`
- `workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through()` / `workflow.unsafe.skip_determinism_enforcement()` — sandbox escape hatches
- `activity_heartbeat()` — heartbeat from inside an activity
- `WorkflowError`, `ActivityError`, `ParentClosePolicy` — all from `mistralai.workflows`

Call activities directly (`await my_activity(args)`); timeouts and retries live on the `@activity(...)` decorator, not at the call site.

## Documentation Structure

### Testing

- **[Testing Workflows](references/guides/testing.md)**: Integration testing with `create_test_worker`, hang prevention, sandbox pitfalls
- **[Diagnostics](references/guides/diagnostics.md)**: Run `wf-diagnose` locally or on Kubernetes to collect a diagnostic report for support triage

**Quick-test script** — run any workflow in a local test environment with zero setup:
```bash
python .agents/skills/workflows/scripts/test_workflow.py <workflow_file> --input '{"key": "value"}' [--timeout 30]
```

**Timeout policy for testing:** Use aggressive (short) timeouts to keep the feedback loop tight. A hanging test wastes more time than a false timeout. Defaults:

| Context | Recommended timeout | When to increase |
|---|---|---|
| `--timeout` (quick-test script) | `15` seconds | Workflow makes multiple LLM calls or heavy I/O |
| `execution_timeout` (pytest) | `timedelta(seconds=10)` | Known long-running workflow |
| `asyncio.wait_for` (pytest) | `15` seconds | Should always be slightly above `execution_timeout` |

If a workflow is known to be long-running (e.g. multi-step agent, large data processing), increase timeouts proportionally — but start short and only raise them when you see legitimate timeout failures, not preemptively.

**Lint & check** — validate your code before running it. Three checks are available:
- `make lint` — Ruff: style, imports, and common errors (`make format` auto-fixes most)
- `make typecheck` — mypy static type checking
- `make lint-workflows` — Semgrep workflow rules: determinism violations, I/O outside activities, missing return-type annotations, unsafe imports (advisory — reports but does not block)

Run all three at once after writing or editing a workflow, and address any findings:
```bash
make check
```
